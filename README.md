Programmed in [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/) and using the static site generator [elm-pages](https://elm-pages.com/), as well as some Clojure to import data from my old Wordpress install. Also uses [Pico.css](https://picocss.com/) for styles, because I can't be assed to properly design it right now, I just want it working and looking decent. Work in progress.
