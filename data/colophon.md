This blog was hand programmed and designed by me (Ale,) in the
[Elm][elm] programming language, using the [elm-pages][elm-pages]
framework and [Tailwind CSS][tailwind] for the styling. [The source
code is available on Github.][source] It was coded mostly using the
[Helix][helix] editor.

This is a static website, which means that no code runs on the server
and has no database.

**This website collects no data** from its visitors.

**No content in this blog was produced using generative AI
technologies,** which includes the articles, images, and code I made
myself. I make no claim about third-party code I've used or sources I
link to, but I sure hope they don't, either.

Also see the [/about](/about) page for more about me (the author) and
this blog.
