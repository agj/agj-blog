I wanted to highlight some new stuff on the [front page](http://www.agj.cl/), but ended up redesigning it. I like this new version much better than the last one, even though it's just a retool gone a bit out of hand. Other than still featuring Cleo, it includes a favorite feature of mine: random colors. Another 'feature': it doesn't work properly in IE.

As always, the previous design has been [archived](http://www.agj.cl/files/archive/front2009-3/).
