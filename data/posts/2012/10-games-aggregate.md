This was long overdue: **[a browser for all of my released games](http://www.agj.cl/games/)**, including the terrible ones, and covering all the range up to the mediocre. I used a binary system for highlighting the ones I consider to be less unremarkable; they use up double the space of the others. There's also a handy tag there called [_gamey_](http://www.agj.cl/games/#tags:gamey) that marks the games that are more traditional in scope, so you don't have to bitch to me about how my games are not really games.
