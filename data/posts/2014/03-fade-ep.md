By mistake I opened the folder where I keep my music projects, and was struck by the sense of nostalgia. I browsed them, listened to all the tracks and unfinished bits thereof I made many years ago. I decided to string some of them, the more complete and the more listenable, into an EP, this one here I call _Fade._ It's only 15 minutes of lo-fi/bleep music, and it's probably not even worth a listen, but here, I release it nonetheless.

(Head into the post to listen without downloading.)

These tracks are all from 2009 at the newest. Since those days I haven't been making music, except for the occasional track for a game. I know no one's missing all the crap music I haven't made these years, but I sometimes think of that parallel me who focused more on music and perhaps became proficient in an instrument, and wonder if I wish I was that me.
