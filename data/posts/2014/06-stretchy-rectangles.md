This is contract work I did some months ago but neglected to post about. It's just a visual effect that my client wanted to implement in [the website they were commissioned](http://www.fildoux.com/), but I think it's a pretty nifty one. The site's links are distributed in an array of rectangular picture crops of different proportions, which stretch and compress according to mouse input. So of course I did just the programming for this one. That's all!
