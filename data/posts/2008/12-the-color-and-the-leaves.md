In six days, spaced over three weekends, three guys online, recording songs collaboratively, grabbing what the other made and putting some guitar on top, or some stream-of-consciousness vocals, or some crazy radio static. That was the dynamic that resulted in the creation of _Tree_, a full-length (well, 30 minutes long) digital release by The Color and the Leaves project!

What we lack in technical skills we make up for in craziness, I think. Lots of good stuff in there, and I can even count some of my own in that category! Tools used (other than the boring ones) include: a Game Boy emulator, an actual Game Boy, a keyboard running out of batteries, and a kettle. The two guys who made this with me are Matt Peter (go listen to [his stuff](http://www.fireandrobot.com/)) and Cody Ross (first timer, like me---though he can actually play his musical instruments, which is _unlike_ me).

~~[Play it streamed or download song by song](http://cllct.com/release/tree)~~ [link dead], or just get [the whole thing in one zip file](//www.agj.cl/files/music/colorleaves/tree/The%20Color%20and%20the%20Leaves%20-%20Tree.zip) (69 MB). Here are the [detailed credits](//www.agj.cl/files/music/colorleaves/tree/tree_credits.txt). [Edit: These were compiled by Matt, forgot to mention that. Cool.]

(Edit: You can stream it from the player at the bottom of this post.)

If you think that having this digital thing sitting there in your harddrive is not very exciting, and decide to burn it on a CD, here's a [sleeve design](//www.agj.cl/files/music/colorleaves/tree/tree_sleeve.pdf) I made, which you can print on a regular letter, or similar sized, paper sheet (on both sides). After you print it, all you need to do is fold around the edges of the square, length-wise first. The overlapping flaps can be fit one into the other to neatly close it.
