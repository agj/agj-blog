I've refreshed the [front page](http://www.agj.cl/). The new design sports a rather subtle effect that nonetheless took me a fair number of hours to pull off, in part because I'm still not that familiar with javascript, but also because it was far more complicated than I originally estimated. It may not work as it's supposed to in browsers other than Firefox and Safari's latest versions, since it hasn't been tested beyond those.

The [previous design](http://www.agj.cl/files/archive/front2010-1/)'s been archived.
