I'm sorry to bring it up again, but, as it turns out, [The Lake](http://blog.agj.cl/tag/the-lake/) earned [ninth place in the TIGSource Commonplace Book competition](http://tigsource.com/articles/2008/12/24/commonplace-book-compo-results), so I'm quite proud. On top of that, the game made it into [an article in the PC Gamer UK magazine](http://blog.agj.cl/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/pc_gamer_lovecraft_writeup_big.jpg). That screenshot comes courtesy of [Terry Cavanagh](http://distractionware.com/).
