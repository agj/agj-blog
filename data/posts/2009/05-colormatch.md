Another month, another [klik](http://blog.agj.cl/tag/kotm/). I had no plan and I was late, so I just made the first thing that came to mind, which was this thing: the ultimate twitch-reflex action, color-based game. Yes, it's that bad. Used [Construct](http://www.scirra.com/), once again, plus [LMMS](http://lmms.sourceforge.net/) and [sfxr](http://www.cyd.liu.se/~tompe573/hp/project_sfxr.html) for the audio.

[**Download Colormatch**](http://www.agj.cl/files/games/colormatch.zip) (Windows, requires [latest DirectX](http://www.softpedia.com/get/System/OS-Enhancements/DirectX-9.0c-Redistributable.shtml))
