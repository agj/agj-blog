[A game I made in 2012](/2012/12/spwords), I made it again. That's about it! [It's playable from the same address as before.](http://www.agj.cl/files/games/spwords/)

Well, I guess I'll explain a bit more. Actually this is old news, as I finished this “remake” back in 2023. I actually spent a few years of very occasional work on it, rewriting it from the vanilla JavaScript I made it originally in, to Elm, and slowly tweaking and improving it. As it stands currently, it's not so different from how it was back when I originally made it for the TIGSource compo. It's the same game, but it has three speeds, single and two-player hotseat (single keyboard) play modes, and more commentary text. It's also a bit prettier, too.

I remade it because I still enjoyed the concept; I think it's a cute game. I wanted to experiment with making games in Elm, and rewriting this game's source code, which I wrote when I was still not very experienced, seemed like a good idea.

The new code still doesn't leave me fully satisfied (I've grown in my experience using Elm since then, too,) but it being Elm, it's a hell of a lot nicer. I'll leave the door open for future improvements, like audio and stuff.
